Implementing modifications to the Rocket Patrol tutorial game created in class


Author: Marlene Lopez
Duration: 43 hours (I really struggled but it was fun)


Assignment: Rocket Patrol Mods [~10â€“15 hours]
Name of the Game: Roadkill

I chose to make it roadkill themed and color coordinated the point system
display with the color of the car that represents the player
the goal is to run over as many racoons as possible and the art
I created for the game is meant to represent a road and cars crashing into
racoons that in the explosion become casualties as shown with blood
the sounds are also car sounds like starting the engine, screeching tires,
and a thud when the body of the animal collides with the car.
instead of sci-fi it is urban.

Play the game:  https://dokimar.github.io/RocketPatrol_mods/


Points Breakdown:
(5)  Track a high score that persists across scenes and display it in the UI
(5)  Allow the player to control the rocket after it's fired
(30) Implement a simultaneous two-player mode
(60) Redesign the game's artwork, UI, and sound to change its theme/aesthetic (to something other than sci-fi)
--- Total Points: 105 ---

For the sad looking pixel art, I made it myself using Photoshop.
But for the three sound pieces, I got them off of opengameart.org
